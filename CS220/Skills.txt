Calculations:
	The level of all the skills are level 1
	The value is calculated by taking the caster's actual power multiplied by its current value(starting values differ per skill), and is multiplied by the skill's level
	The value of the mana requirement is multiplied by the skill's level
Skills:
	Sword Attack (0 mana) - a base damage skill that requires no mana. All the values are calculated similar to the other skills.
	Fireball (50 mana) - a skill that causes damage on an enemy
	Healing (150 mana) - a skill that heals the caster
	Knock Out (100 mana) - a skill that knocks the enemies out. While knocked out, a player can't cast any skills on this or the next round. There is also a recoil damage.
